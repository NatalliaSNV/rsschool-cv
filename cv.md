In my position I reached the maximum, besides I realized that I want to try myself in another sphere. My choice fell on the profession of a front-end developer. In my opinion, I am suitable for this profession, and it suits me. I have an analytical mindset, well trained, purposeful, attentive.I have experience of working in a team.
